### What I'm Currently Working On: Rocket Build for High Powered Rocketry Certification

I'm planning to build a 4-inch LOC-IV rocket with a DMS H100 motor and obtain my Level 1 High Powered Rocketry Certification. I'll then lead my i5 Space team in obtaining their certification as well as an exploration of space technology to deepen our understanding of the space domain.

### Freewing Experimental Aircraft Build

From January to May 2023, I was a member of the Hardware Integration Team for Husky Flying Club's Freewing Drone Build Project. The two-meter experimental drone has front wings that can freely rotate on their axis, giving the drone’s center of gravity mobility along its length. Designed for aerial agricultural fertilization, the drone won the $15,000 prize in the Alaska Airlines Environmental Innovation Challenge. I developed proficiency in the following tools to machine and assemble its aluminum frame: vertical drill press, horizontal bandsaw, belt sander, and rivet gun. I also designed and built the foam nose cone using a hot wire bow cutter.
